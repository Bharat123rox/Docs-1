# Import your model to Gradient

Importing a model file trained elsewhere to be saved & then deployed within Gradient is very simple.

Just create an experiment that reads in the desired model file & have it output to --modelPath & --modelType. This way it gets picked up by the Gradient system & is available for 1 click deployment!
