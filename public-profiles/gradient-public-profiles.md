# Gradient Public Profiles

{% hint style="success" %}
Gradient Public Profiles are still in BETA. The look/feel will change during this development phase. We welcome all feedback/suggestions to continue to make this feature more powerful and rich
{% endhint %}

## Creating your public profile

To create your public profile visit the console page and click `Profile` in the dropdown menu. This will take you to your current public profile. By default your namespace is set to your auto-generated internal handle \(i.e. `t98sga1`\)

Click `Edit Profile` to set your username, public profile description, and more.

Your username follows a GitHub-style convention and will be accessible at **https://www.paperspace.com/{your\_username}**

## **Sharing public notebooks**

[Public notebooks](../notebooks/public-notebooks.md) are a new feature in Gradient.  They allow you to run a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and easily share it with others. A Gradient Notebook is actually an entire self-contained container with all libraries, dependencies, and files contained within it. This means that you can easily create complex ML applications without worrying about having others run install scripts, run in to dependency management issues, and more.

Once a notebook is made `public` it will show up under your public profile for others to view and fork in to their own account. 

## Roadmap

Gradient Public profiles are still very much a work-in-progress. Notebooks are the first to be enabled for profiles, but soon we will be adding [Projects](../projects/create-a-project.md), [Models](../models/create-a-model.md), [Datasets](../data/managing-data-in-gradient.md), and more.

As always, we are eager to hear your feedback. Now go claim your username and we are excited to see what you build! ðŸ™Œ
