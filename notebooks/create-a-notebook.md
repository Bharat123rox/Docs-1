# Create a Notebook

## Choose your Base Container

Notebooks can be created by clicking _Create Notebook_ button on the Notebooks tab.  There are two types of base containers:

### Public Containers \(Basic\)

## Optional Settings:

### Name your Notebook

Provide a friendly name for your Notebook in the text field

### Auto-shutdown

If you are a [Gradient 1 \(or higher\) subscriber](https://support.paperspace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002068913), you will have the ability to set a custom auto-shutdown interval. 

If you are a Gradient 0 subscriber, your notebook will default to an auto-shutdown interval of 12 hours, to help avoid unexpected runtime charges. Once created, you can stop, start, fork, and swap out the instance type anytime. 

## Click Create

That's it! Your Notebook will start once it has been created. ðŸš€
