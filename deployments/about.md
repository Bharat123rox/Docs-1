  Gradient Deployments enable a hassle-free, automatic “push to deploy” option
  for any trained model. These allow ML practitioners to quickly validate
  “end-to-end” services from R&D to production.

## Overview

Deploy any model as a high-performance, low-latency micro-service with a RESTful API. Easily monitor, scale, and version deployments.  Deployments take a trained model and expose them as a persistent service at a known URI.

## Current Capabilities

* Out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models, but can be easily extended to serve other types of models and data.\(ONNX coming soon\)
* A variety of GPU & CPU SKUs to deploy to
* Per Second Billing
* Multi instance deployments with load balancing
* Dedicated endpoint URI per deployment
* Accessible via the CLI, Web UI or API
