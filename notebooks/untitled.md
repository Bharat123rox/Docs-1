# About

Gradient notebooks are an interactive environment \(based on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Jupyter Lab](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)\) for developing and running code. You can run Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts and much more, on a GPU, CPU, or even a TPU. A Gradient ****Notebook = access to a Jupyter Notebook instance. Within that instance you can have limitless notebook documents. You can think of a Gradient Notebook as your persistent, on-demand workspace in the cloud.

## File Storage

Any data stored in `/storage` will be preserved for you, across restarts. Persistent storage is backed by a filesystem and is ideal for storing data like images, datasets, model checkpoints etc.  Learn more about persistent storage [here.](https://support.paperspace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001468133-Persistent-Storage)
