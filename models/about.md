# About

### Model Repository 

Paperspace Experiments can generate machine learning models, which can be interpreted and stored in the Paperspace Model Repository. The Repository holds references to the checkpoint files generated during the training period as well as summary metrics associated with the model's performance, such as accuracy and loss.

You can see all of your Models in the GUI or via the CLI.

**Currently Supported Models:**

* [TensorFlow 1.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model)

**Future Supported Models:**

* ONNX

### Enabling Support for your Models

To store model information in the Model Repository, add model-specific parameters to the experiment command when running an experiment. 

#### Model Type

`--modelType` defines the type of model that is being generated by the experiment. For example, `--modelType Tensorflow` will ensure that the model checkpoint files being generated are recognized as Tensorflow model files.

| Model Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 \(or Tensorflow\) | Tensorflow compatible model outputs |
| 2 \(or ONNX\) | ONNX open source model outputs |
| 3 \(default\) | Unknown model output format |

_Note: Paperspace Deployments currently support Tensorflow models using Tensorflow Serving, so you'll want to use this option in order to take advantage of of Deployments._

#### Model Path

`--modelPath` defines where in the context of the experiment the model checkpoint files are being stored. This is a key argument that enables the evaluation and upload of the generated model files. One option is to set `--modelPath '/artifacts'` and keep the checkpoint files around only in the context of the experiment. Another option is to set `--modelPath '/storage/my-experiment'` to have permanent access to the model generated files in  your Paperspace storage.
