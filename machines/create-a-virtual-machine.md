# Create a virtual machine

## About

Create a new Paperspace virtual machine. If you are using an individual account, you will be assigned as the owner of the machine. If you are a team administrator, you must specify the user that should be assigned to the machine, either by specifying a user id, or by providing an email address, password, first name and last name for the creation of a new user on the team.
