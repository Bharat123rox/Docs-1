# Gradient Community Notebooks

In October, 2019, we launched the beta of Gradient Community Notebooks â€“ [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VtgyUJxwWo5HQIW_GKZvue_sW9R7PJANa_USdQJ4yaE)!

Gradient Community Notebooks allow you to create, run, and share your Jupyter Notebooks with the world. The goal is to offer a product that makes it easy and fun to share your work with others, to discover and fork notebooks from other users, and to introduce social features to Gradient.

Gradient Community Notebooks can be viewed with anyone, regardless of having a Paperspace account.

With this launch, you can now create a [Public Profile](https://www.paperspace.com/jared) and a user or team handle.

During the Beta, we are stabilizing this new product offering, and we'd love to hear your feedback on Community Notebooks, whether [feature requests](https://paperspace.canny.io/feature-requests) or [bug reports](https://feedback.canny.io/bug-reports)!

 Our goal is to release Community Notebooks to the general public in the coming weeks!

Community Notebooks take advantage of the newly released [Free Instances](../instances/free-instances.md) on Gradient. This means that they will be Public-only and will auto-shutdown after 6 hours.

#### Forking Community Notebooks

You can fork any Gradient Community Notebook by clicking the green Play button at the top of that notebook's public page. For now, this will fork the notebook into your private workspace. Soon it will allow you to fork into a team of your choice.

_Note: By making your notebook Public, the underlying container will be able to be forked to other users' accounts, including if they are within a private container registry. So, as with anytime you would share a container, be sure not to remove any sensitive data, such as API keys or secrets, before making that notebook Public!_
