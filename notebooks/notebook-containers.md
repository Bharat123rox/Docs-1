# Notebook Containers

## Base Containers

When you launch a Notebook, it runs inside a container preloaded with the notebook files and dependencies.  See the list of containers that Paperspace maintains [here](https://support.paperspace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001597074-Base-Containers).

## Custom Containers

Custom containers feature lets you pull your own image from Docker Hub. This article will help you prepare a custom Docker container to use with Gradient, show you how to bring that Container into Gradient, and create a notebook with your custom container. We recommend using Docker to get the container image from your system to Gradient. 

See a tutorial on using custom containers [here](https://support.paperspace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008256453-Creating-Using-Custom-Containers-with-Notebooks).
