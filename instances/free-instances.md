# Free Instances \(Free Tier\)

### About

Gradient offers a Free Tier of free GPU and CPU instances, currently available to beta users of Gradient Community Notebooks.

These Free Instances are available to all _Private Workspace_ plans \(G\* subscriptions, not T\*\).  

### Instance Types available in the Free Tier

**Free-CPU** — C3 CPU instance

**Free-GPU+** — NVIDIA M4000 GPU

**Free-P5000** — NVIDIA P5000 GPU

See the [Instance Types](instance-types.md) page for the details on these instances.

### Limits of Free Instances

All free instances have the same limits, regardless of your subscription plan:

* Notebooks will automatically shutdown after 6 hours per session
  * There are currently no limits to the number of sessions you can run
* All Notebooks \(and Jobs coming soon\) will be set to public and cannot be set to private
* 5GB of [persistent storage](../data/storage.md#persistent-storage) is included for free — this cannot be expanded

_Note: We are currently offering a limited pool of free instances so your notebook may be Pending in the queue as you wait for a free instance to become available. If you need immediate access to machines, please consider upgrading to a paid subscription plan._
